# Vagrantfile Samples

### Introduction

In a nutshell, Vagrant is a tool for working with virtual environments, and in most circumstances, this means working with virtual machines. Vagrant provides a simple and easy to use command-line client for managing these environments, and an interpreter for the text-based definitions of what each environment looks like, called Vagrantfiles. Vagrant is open source, which means that anyone can download it, modify it, and share it freely.

### Why Vagrant?

Most of the devops tools we use commonly need different dependent software to be installed. We also need to install work flow specific software. It helps to have a Vagrant box that can boot up with all these software installed during bootup aka bootstrapping. We provide access to vagrantfiles that will have bootstrapping code.

1. [AWS](https://github.com/barracudanetworks/waf-automation/tree/master/vagrant/AWS) : Prepares a VM to act as a Puppet Agent. The Vagrantfile is customized for an AWS environment.
2. [Azure](https://github.com/barracudanetworks/waf-automation/tree/master/vagrant/Azure) : Prepares a VM to act as a Puppet Agent. The Vagrantfile is customized for an Azure environment.
3. [Foreman](https://github.com/barracudanetworks/waf-automation/tree/master/vagrant/Foreman) : Creates a VM with Foreman and Puppet master preinstalled. Useful for testing in a dev environment.

**Please check the bottom of the vagrantfile to see the bootstrapping shell script.**

### How-to

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)
2. Create a directory for your environment (eg. AWS or Azure) within the Vagrant installation path
3. Place the relevant vagrantfile from this repo, into the directory. (You can avoid this step if the directory is copied from this space instead of creating a new directory as mentioned in step 2)
4. Execute `vagrant up`
5. To SSH into the machine `vagrant ssh`
6. To stop the machine `vagrant halt`
