# Automating Application Security with Barracuda WAF and Puppet on AWS

### Introduction
Barracuda Web Application Firewall provides comprehensive based protection for applications deployed in physical, virtual, or public cloud environments. 
Puppet Enterprise delivers a unified platform that allows you to both enforce the desired state of your configurations and automatically remediate any unexpected changes, and to automate ad hoc tasks across infrastructure and applications.
Amazon Web Services offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services.

### How does this solution work

Barracuda WAF can protect web applications from being targeted by attackers. A virtual service is configured to front end the web application, thus ensuring all the traffic targeting the servers are inspected for malicious content.

Barracuda Networks provides a free cloud based centralized management solution called the Barracuda Cloud Control. A free cloud based web application penetration testing framework called the Barracuda Vulnerability Remediation Service is also available to be integrated with the Barracuda WAF. A Cloud Control user can utilize the Barracuda VRS and setup scans for services created on a Cloud Control Managed Barracuda WAF. These scans can also be scheduled and the reports delivered to the email address of the account holder.

The solution ensures that the Barracuda WAF that is being managed in this lab is connected to the Barracuda Cloud Control account specified in the puppet manifest after being configured with an HTTPS service.

### Setting up the environment

   This step is divided into two sections i.e. Section A and Section B

### Section A
   #### Launching the Puppet Master and Agents

   This section of the lab will be used to cover the launch of the Puppet ecosystem which will be used for the demo.

   Once the Puppet Environment CFT is imported :

### Configuring the EC2 instance of the Puppet Master 

   Note: Do not change the Hostname: If you wish to change the hostname, follow the instructions mentioned here: 
   https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.2/ami_intro.html#changing-the-masters-hostname-and-regenerating-certificates

#### Checking if the services are up:

``` bash
/opt/puppetlabs/aws/bin/check_status.sh --wait
check_status.sh: Configuring Puppet Enterprise services.......

This can take up to 7-8 minutes as the services get configured after which you should get an output such as below:

check_status.sh: Configuring Puppet Enterprise services...............
check_status.sh: Puppet Enterprise is fully active.
check_status.sh: Puppet Enterprise console (username "admin") is available at:
  https://ec2.compute.amazonaws.com
check_status.sh: To set the console password and obtain access, run:
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/aws/bin/set_console_password.sh
```

#### Setting the password 

```bash
sudo /opt/puppetlabs/aws/bin/set_console_password.sh
```

#### Web Login

https://<public_ip> : Username is admin and password is the console password set with the above command

#### Creating a new environment

Path: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/

#### Cloning the code
Go to /home/puppetadmin

git clone https://github.com/barracudanetworks/waf-automation.git

#### Installing the AWS Module
Path: /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/

```puppet
puppet module install barracuda-cudawaf –environment=production
```
#### Moving the code to the Puppet environment
```bash
sudo cp –r /home/puppetadmin/waf-automation/aws-puppet-waf-hands_on_lab/waf_manifests/* /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/cudawaf/manifests/
```
#### Handling Dependencies

1. Install Typhoeus
```bash
/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver gem install typhoeus
```

2. Install  rest-client (Needs gcc and gcc-c++ yum packages as dependencies)

```bash
yum install gcc
yum install gcc-c++
/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver gem install rest-client -v 1.8.0
```
#### Configure the site.pp file as necessary to match the hostnames of the nodes.

Set up the /opt/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

```puppet
node default
{
include cudawaf::dependency
}

node <waf>
{
include cudawaf::waf_configuration
}
```
#### Install the gem files using puppet agent gem binary on the Puppet Master

The "puppet agent -t" command will execute the instructions in the dependency.pp if the site.pp file is set for the node 'default' to include 'cudawaf::dependency'

#### Elevate permissions for the gemspec files

```bash
chmod 777 /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.1/specifications/typhoeus-1.*
chmod 777 /opt/puppetlabs/puppet/lib/ruby/gems/2.0.1/specifications/rest-client*
```

#### Configuring the Puppet Agent

Configuring the host name resolution for the Puppet Master
Path: /etc/hosts
Use a text editor.
Create a local hosts entry to point the hostname of the Puppet Master to the Private ip address

#### Installing puppet on the agent
curl –kv puppetmaster-ip:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash

#### Run the Puppet agent
This is necessary to:
1. To send the CSR to the Puppet master for signing
2. To retrieve the catalog from the master for the dependency handling

```puppet
puppet agent -t 
```

## Section B
   #### Launching the Production Network

This section of the lab will be used to launch the base network for workflow labs that will be covered during the training.

#### Important note:

•	Create at least one SSH Key pair in the AWS region where the stack will be deployed

•	Download the SSH key to your local computer and lower the permission for the key file.

•	Changing the permissions for the SSH private key: 

chmod 400 <privatekey.pem>

•	The firmware version on the Barracuda Web Application Firewall should be v9.1.1.x

#### Stack Creation
Launch Parameters: Choose the default settings.

#### WAF recommended instance size: M4 Large

There are 6 Private Subnets in the VPC. These subnets initiate outbound traffic through a NAT gateway. 
Use Private Subnets 3 and 4 for the WordPress web tiers
Use Private Subnets 5 and 6 for the RDS (Create the RDS DB Subnet Group with these subnets)

#### Setting up the DB Subnet Group (To install WP)

RDS is used to serve as the DB for the WordPress Application. DB subnet group is configured in this step.
Setting up WordPress

Import the 3rd CFT wpstack.template
Note: Make sure the DB Password is an alphanumeric string.
Note: This stack creation process takes about 30 minutes to complete.

### Barracuda Web Application Firewall

1.	Login Details: http://<publicip>:8000/
 
2.	Username: admin

3.	Password: <EC2 instance ID for this node>


Step-1: Accept the End User License Agreement

Step-2: Login

### Summary
In this lab, a Puppet ecosystem comprising a Puppet Master and two Ubuntu based agent nodes were configured in addition to setting up a base network with a different VPC.

### Puppet Manifest for this Lab

The file waf_configuration.pp file includes the resource types shown below. Examples of different kinds of configuration using Puppet manifests:

#### Create a SSL certificate
```puppet
 cudawaf_certificate { 'selfsigned_cert':
      ensure => present,
      name  => 'testcert',
      allow_private_key_export =>'Yes',
      city   =>'san_franscisco,
      common_name=> 'puppet.labs.com',
      country_code => 'US',
      curve_type => 'secp256r1',
      key_size => 1024,
      key_type => 'rsa',
      organization_name => 'techkaizen.net',
      organization_unit => 'devops',
      state => 'california',
    }
```
#### Create a HTTPS service
```puppet
cudawaf_service { 'https_service':
      ensure        => present,
      name          => 'Prod_App',
      type          => 'https',
      ip_address    => '10.36.73.245',
      port          =>  443,
      certificate   => 'testcert',
      group         => 'default',
      vsite         => 'default',
      status        => 'On',
      address_version => 'IPv4',
      comments      => 'This is the production service for the lab',
    }
```
#### Create the backend server
```puppet
cudawaf_server { 'http_backend':
      ensure => present,
      name => 'ALB_backend',
      identifier => 'IP Address',
      address_version => 'IPv4',
      status => 'In Service',
      ip_address => '5.5.5.5',
      hostname => '',
      service_name => 'httpsApp1',
      port => 80,
      comments => 'Creating the server'
    }

```
#### Connect WAF to Barracuda Cloud Control
```puppet
  cudawaf_cloudcontrol { 'WAFCloudControlSettings':
      ensure         => present,
      connect_mode   => 'cloud',
      state          => 'connected',
      username       => 'customer_account@example.com',
      password       => 'xxxxxxxx'
    }
```
### Puppet Device

The Puppet Agent works as a proxy system to connect and apply the manifest on the WAF.

The functions of the Puppet Device subcommand are as follows:

 •	Performs the certificate authentication for the WAF nodes

 •	Retrieves Facter “facts” from the WAF nodes

 •	Sends the facts to the Puppet Master

 •	Retrieves the catalog and applies on the WAF node

To implement and use Puppet Device, its required to create a device.conf file. You may create this file in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/device.conf on the Puppet Agent.

 ##### Sample “device.conf” file

 ```bash
 [waf-1]
    type cudawaf
    url http://admin:<password>@<ip_address>:8000/
 ```
#### Command to run on the agent:

1.	For help
```puppet
puppet help device
```

2.	To run the puppet device 
```puppet
puppet device –v --user=root
```
When this command is run for the first time, a CSR for the device is sent to the master, and its required that the master sign this csr from the device.
To complete this step, execute the following command on the Puppet master
```puppet
puppet cert sign waf-1

where waf-1 is the name of the device as defined in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/device.conf on the puppet agent.
```

At this point in time, you may login to https://vrs.barracudanetworks.com and add a web application. You should be able to update the waf list in the "add web application" widget, which will allow you to select the waf that was previously connected to Cloud Control and thus VRS. You may also modify the scan configuration as necessary.
